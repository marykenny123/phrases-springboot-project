# Phrases API - Spring Boot Project

**Phrases** is a CRUD API for managing inspiring phrases and their author.  
It follows the 3 layer architecture (Models-Repositories-Controllers) and connects to a MySQL database using Spring Boot and JPA..  
This project is part of my learning journey in Java programming, software architecture, and database integration and my first spring boot project.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**
   https://github.com/marykenny123/phrases-springboot-project.git
2. Set up the MySQL database
3. Create a database named phrases
4. You don't need to create a table
7. Compile and run


## TESTING with Postman

Postman has been used to simulate front-end interactions with the user and to test whether all statements are functioning correctly. The results of each CRUD method can be checked directly in Postman and are updated in MySQL, therefore also allowing verification in the database.
